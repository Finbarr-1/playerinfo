# Contributing to playerinfo
### Prerequisites
First off, you probably want to install [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). It is very useful for Java development, and there are [a couple plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) that make Minecraft development easier.

### Requirements
Anything added to the client be either a feature available in most popular/mainstream PvP clients or something that isn't considered a hack, cheat or exploit.  
For example, perspective mod is a feature that's available on every popular PvP client, which means it's okay to add. The Bedwars resource indicator mod is something that isn't availble in most PvP clients, but wouldn't be considered a cheat or anything like that.  

### Ways to Contribute
You can either fork the repository, create the module yourself and make a pull request, or you can create an issue with a feature request for the module.  
To create an issue, use the predefined feature request template and add the details for the mod you want.  
To create the module yourself, fork the repository, clone the forked repository and create the module. For more information, refer to the wiki.
