### A Minecraft mod that does some cool stuff.

---

### Features
* Lifx Integration
* Hypixel Bedwars quick play menu
* Super zoom (default key is Y, but it can be changed in controls)
* Disabling pumpkin overlay (shows pumpkin icon in top right corner instead)
* Fetch player information (displaying information is still a work in progress)
* Background blurring in a GUI
* Options menu
* Note block helper (shows notes in chat)
* Calculator
* ToggleSprint
* In-game Widgets (they are movable!)
  * Coordinates
  * ToggleSprint
  * BedWars Resources Indicator
  * Scoreboard
    * Disable Numbers
    * Change Color
  * CPS Display (both left and right)
* Custom Main Menu (can be disabled; doesn't look particularly good at the moment)
* Display Tweaks (disable water overlay)
* Hypixel events (friends joining and leaving)

### Note
This project was created for fun, and I don't expect anyone but myself (and maybe some friends) to actually use it. I would recommend instead using a more well-known, well-made and well-maintained PvP client such as LunarClient or Badlion Client.
